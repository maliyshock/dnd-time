          <p>This is an interactive clocks. They can be used for to track / change / save time inside of your Dungeons and Dragons world.</p>

            <li>
              By default, if there is no saved session, the timer starts from your current local time. When you reopen the tab, time resumes from where you left
              off.
            </li>
            <li>Time is saved every second automatically in your browser storage. Clearing cache will erase saved data.</li>
            <li>You can change hours, minutes and seconds. Pause and resume clocks at any time.</li>
            <li>
              The sky color and sun position reflect in-game time and can be used as an inspiration for the time description. Because... you know, there is no
              clocks in medieval fantasy world there. ðŸ™‚

              Create, rename, and delete multiple timers. <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">(Work in progress)</span>
            </li>
            <li>Works in the background: the timer keeps running even if the browser tab is not active (but not when the computer is asleep or turned off).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="mt-6 text-xl leading-none font-semibold">Additional Features:</h3>
          <ul className="my-2 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2">
            <li>Music and sound effects for each interaction.</li>
            <li>Visual effects: smooth gradient transition, stars animation, interactions and easter eggs even. ðŸ™‚</li>
            <li>Dynamic clouds: clouds appear and move randomly.</li>
            <li>
              Rain <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">(Work in progress).</span>

          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl leading-none font-semibold">Yeah... but why?</h3>
          <p>Is not it looks and feels nice? ðŸ™‚</p>
          <p>Besides that, I really love immersive D&D worlds. Frequently, during our sessions we were lost in time, because nobody tracked it: </p>
          <p>â€“ "Hey DM what time is it?"</p>
          <p> â€“ "Uh, letâ€™s say itâ€™s around 3 pm"</p>

          <p>... and it is just felt wrong. I could not find any tool, so I decided to build my own. Hope you enjoy it.</p>
